She worked closely with the program facilitators, gradually building confidence and discovering creative ways to blend digital tools with her traditional teaching methods.",
                    "A breakthrough came when she used the platform to create an interactive lesson on local ecology. Students who had been disengaged suddenly showed enthusiasm, asking questions and actively participating. Mrs. Mthethwa realized that technology wasn't replacing her teaching—it was enhancing it.",

                    "His first major challenge was the persistent digital divide. While urban schools were increasingly connected and equipped with modern resources, rural schools remained isolated. Previous attempts to bridge this gap had been expensive and unsustainable, with projects abandoning communities once initial funding ran out.",

                    "Securing funding wasn't easy. Mr. Dlamini had to convince skeptical colleagues, present data-driven arguments, and build coalitions with private sector partners. He spent countless hours visiting rural schools, gathering firsthand accounts of challenges and potential solutions.",
